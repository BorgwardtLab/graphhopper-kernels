# Scalable kernels for graphs with continuous attributes

## Code

A MATLAB implementation of the GraphHopper kernel as proposed in [1]. An implementation of the propagation kernel as presented in [2] is also included. Installation instructions are below.

## Installation

The functions `runntimes.m` and `runIndependent.m` assume that LibSVM along with its MATLAB interface is installed. This can be downloaded from: [http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/.](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/.)


## Datasets

The following datasets used in the paper are available in the folder `CodeandData`: 
* ENZYMES 
* PROTEINS 
* SYNTHETIC

as well as 

* ENZYMES\_symmetrized 
* SYNTHETICnew  

Note that the datasets ENZYMES and PROTEINS have previously appeared with discretized node features, this version of the data has continuous-valued features as described in our NIPS submission.

Please, refer to the file `README/README.txt` for further information on usage and installation of previous versions.
